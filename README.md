# windArd

`windArd` is an optimization suite for multi-disciplinary optimization of wind farms.

The technical goals of `windArd` are to:
1) allow optimization of wind farm layouts for specific wind resource profiles
2) target wholistic, system-level optimization objectives
3) incorporate multi-fidelity analyses to integrate physics-resolving simulation

As a code, the goal of `windArd` is to be:
1) modular: choose the parts you want, skip the ones you don't, build yourself the ones we don't have
2) clean: fully documented, and adhering to best-practices for code development
3) effective: fully tested and testable at the unit and system level, and built with a derivative-forward approach

These will not always be possible, but they are the goal.
